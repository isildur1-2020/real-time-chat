## You can choose any port to create a socket server
`python3 create_server.py 8080`
## Once you create a server, you are able to create socket clients as you wish
`pyhton3 create_client.py 8080`

### The server and clients points to 127.0.0.1 but you can modify Server and Client class to choose any host

### best regards!
